This article is a work in progress. Math is hard and DeFi can be confusing. If you find any errors, feel free to contact me at 
krishang@nftlabs.co with a correction.

This article is Part 1 of a three part series on constant function market makers, mentioned in this three liner 
[Zapper article](https://zapper.crunch.help/defi-investing-101/uniswap-vs-balancer-vs-curve).

Decentralized exchanges (DEX'es) lie at the heart of DeFi. A core piece of each DEX is the math that regulates its asset swaps. 
For instance, swapping a given amount of USDC for DAI on Uniswap, compared to Curve, is not the same. This article will attempt 
to make the constant product market maker function intuitive, the math that Uniswap uses to price its assets, without defaulting to 
jargon or formulae like `x * y = k` without explanation.

This article is not an explanation of how DEX'es or Automated Market Makers work in general. Here, I'll primarily discuss a 
piece of how a DEX works — its market making function. The discussion is primarily centered around Uniswap's constant product 
market maker function.

## Constant product market maker

If you're familiar with Uniswap, you've seen this equation `x * y = k` thrown around.

The equation `x * y = k` governs asset swaps on Uniswap, where `x` and `y` represent the quantities of two different assets in a 
liquidity pool, and `k` represents a value called the *constant product invariant*. The given equation governs the price of a given 
amount of one asset in the liquidity pool, in terms of the other asset. 

Consider a liquidity pool consisting of `Token A` and `Token B`. We can calculate the above mentioned 'constant product invariant' 
or `k` as `k = (Amt. of Token A in pool) * (Amt. Token B in pool)`.

**Pre-trade:** <Latex>$k = Amt. A \times Amt. B$</Latex>

Given the current state of the pool, we want to find out how much a given amount of `Token B` costs, in terms of `Token A`. Now, 
swapping `Token A` for `Token B` changes the composition of the liquidity pool. Our governing equation `x * y = k` dictates that 
the value of the invariant `k` must remain constant, regardless of the composition of the pool post-trade.

**Post-trade:** <Latex displayMode={true}>$k = (Amt. A + x) \times (Amt. B - y)$</Latex>

Here, `x` is the amount of `Token A` we'd have to pay in exchange for `y` amount of `Token B`. Now, Uniswap takes a protocol fee of 
0.3% for every trade. So, when you pay `x` amount of `Token A` in exchange for some amount of `Token B`, what you get in return is 
`0.997x Token A` worth of `Token B`.

**Pricing the trade:** <Latex displayMode={true}>$k = (Amt. A + 0.997x) \times (Amt. B - y)$</Latex>

Again, we want to know the price of a given amount of `Token B` in terms of `Token A` i.e. the amount of `Token A` (`x`) 
you would need to add to the liquidity pool, to receive `y` amount of `Token B`. Therefore, we want to rearrange the equation labelled 
as 'Pricing the trade' to be able to calculate `x` (how much `Token A` you need to pay) as a function of `y` (how much `Token B` 
you want).

**Price of `Token B` in terms of `Token A`:**
<Latex displayMode={true}>{'$f(y) = \\frac{1}{0.997} \\times (\\frac{k}{Amt. B - y} - Amt. A)$'}</Latex>

(Similarly) **Price of `Token A` in terms of `Token B`:**
<Latex displayMode={true}>{'$f(y) = \\frac{1}{0.997} \\times (\\frac{k}{Amt. A - y} - Amt. B)$'}</Latex>

If we are to generalize the equations further, by not fixing the fee at 0.3% like Uniswap —

**Price of `Token B` in terms of `Token A`:**
<Latex displayMode={true}>{'$f(y) = \\frac{1}{1 - fee} \\times (\\frac{k}{Amt. B - y} - Amt. A)$'}</Latex>

(Similarly) **Price of `Token A` in terms of `Token B`:**
<Latex displayMode={true}>{'$f(y) = \\frac{1}{1 - fee} \\times (\\frac{k}{Amt. A - y} - Amt. B)$'}</Latex>

We now have a general equation that we can use to find the price of one asset in a liquidity pool, in terms of the other asset in the 
liquidity pool. Let's work through an example.

Consider a Uniswap liquidity pool containing 100 ETH and 1000 EXAMPLE (an ERC20 token). Here, `k = 100 * 1000 = 10**5`. We calculate 
the price of 1 ETH in terms of EXAMPLE as —

<Latex displayMode={true}>{'Price of 1 ETH $= \\frac{1}{0.997} \\times (\\frac{10^5}{100-1} - 1000) = 10.13$ EXAMPLE'}</Latex>

Note that though `k` is supposed to be an "invariant" i.e. considered as a constant when pricing one asset in terms of the other, 
`k` actually increases a little after every trade, since we account for the 0.3% fee in our equation for pricing the assets. 

In our example, the value of `k` pre-trade is `10**5` whereas the value of `k` post-trade is around `99 * 1010.13 = 100,002.87`. 
If we would charge no fees, the price of 1 ETH in terms of EXAMPLE would be around: <Latex displayMode={true}>$(\frac{10^5}{100-1} - 1000) = 10.10$ EXAMPLE</Latex> 
instead, maintaining `k` at `10**5`. The increase in the size of the liquidity pool (as reflected by the increase in `k`) represents 
the payout to the pool's liquidity providers.
