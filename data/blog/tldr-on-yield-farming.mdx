## Our farm - [pickle.finance](https://pickle.finance/)

You're a yield farmer. You have a share in the *pSLP yvBOOST* */ ETH* farm with 10 units of shares. You open your dashboard and look at 
some metrics: 

- *Locked:* 10 units
- *$PICKLE earnings:* x

Over time, you notice your *$PICKLE* *earnings* go up. You wait for a few days and then exit the farm, unlocking your assets from 
the farm in the process. You receive 10 units of *pSLP yvBOOST* */ ETH* tokens and some amount of *$PICKLE* tokens. 

Here's what just happened — you were rewarded some dollar value $x (the *$PICKLE earnings*) for depositing away your assets 
( *pSLP yvBOOST* */ ETH* tokens) in a smart contract (the farm) for some amount of time.

Where did the dollar value of your rewards come from? 

To avoid any confusion that comes with the elaborate name *pSLP yvBOOST* */ ETH,* let's refer to those tokens as *pTokens*. 

These *pTokens* are a kind of LP token representing some liquidity you provided to the [pickle.finance](http://pickle.finance) app 
(this fact is denoted by the prefix *p* to the token name). You can redeem the underlying assets represented by your particular *pTokens*, 
in exchange for those *pTokens*. For instance, in your case, the underlying asset represented by your *pTokens* (i.e. *pSLP yvBOOST* */ ETH* 
tokens) is *SLP yvBOOST* */ ETH* tokens.

A DeFi app like [pickle.finance](http://pickle.finance) has incentives to discourage liquidity providers from removing their liquidity from its 
platform i.e. exchanging the *pTokens* to get back the underlying asset. DeFi apps work most efficiently when they're handling a large amount of 
capital, and derive legitimacy from growing a user base committed to the apps' long term success.

So, to discourage liquidity providers from removing their liquidity from the platform, the platform rewards its liquidity providers to lock their 
LP tokens into the platform. Locking one's LP tokens in the platform represents some long term commitment to the project. Moreover, from a UX 
standpoint, it makes the act of removing one's provided liquidity from the platform a two step process — 1) unlock, and then 2) withdraw. 

The platform rewards the liquidity providers who have locked their LP tokens, in the platform's own native token — in the case painted above, 
that's *$PICKLE*. The longer you lock your assets for, the greater the amount of rewards i.e. *$PICKLE* you accumulate.

Great — you were rewarded some *$PICKLE* for locking your *pTokens* in the platform for some time. But where does *$PICKLE* derive it's 
dollar value from? Generally, the platform creates a *(reward token) / ETH* liquidity pool on a decentralized exchange. Part of the profits 
generated by the platform's finance-doings are then directed towards this liquidity pool, adding value to each unit of the native platform token.

That's pretty much it! You just farmed some $PICKLE. The act of 1) providing liquidity to some arm of the platform, 2) locking your LP tokens 
into the platform and then, 3) as a result, accumulating rewards in the platform's native token —  this is yield farming.
